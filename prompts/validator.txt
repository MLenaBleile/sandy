You are evaluating a sandwich for validity and quality.

A "sandwich" is a structured knowledge artifact: two related bounding concepts (bread) containing a meaningfully constrained middle concept (filling).

Sandwich:
- Name: {name}
- Bread Top: {bread_top}
- Filling: {filling}
- Bread Bottom: {bread_bottom}
- Structure Type: {structure_type}
- Description: {description}
- Containment Argument: {containment_argument}

Evaluate on these criteria (0.0 to 1.0 each):

1. BREAD COMPATIBILITY: Are the bread elements related but distinct?
   - 1.0: Perfect pairing, clearly related framing concepts that naturally form a pair
   - 0.7: Strong pairing, clearly related with a meaningful connection
   - 0.5: Somewhat related, connection is weak or tenuous
   - 0.3: Barely related, connection requires a stretch
   - 0.0: Completely unrelated or effectively identical

2. CONTAINMENT: Is the filling meaningfully bounded by the bread?
   - 1.0: Filling clearly emerges from / is constrained by / exists between the bread elements; removing either bread fundamentally changes the filling's meaning
   - 0.7: Strong containment, the filling is well-bounded
   - 0.5: Connection is loose or somewhat forced
   - 0.3: Filling is only tangentially related to the bread
   - 0.0: Filling has no real relationship to bread; it could exist independently without loss

You MUST be rigorous about containment. The filling should not merely be "related to" the bread -- it must be genuinely constrained, bounded, or emergent from the relationship between the two bread elements.
