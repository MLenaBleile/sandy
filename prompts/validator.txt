You are evaluating a sandwich for validity and quality.

A "sandwich" is a structured knowledge artifact: two related bounding concepts (bread) containing a meaningfully constrained middle concept (filling).

Sandwich:
- Name: {name}
- Bread Top: {bread_top}
- Filling: {filling}
- Bread Bottom: {bread_bottom}
- Structure Type: {structure_type}
- Description: {description}
- Containment Argument: {containment_argument}

Evaluate on these criteria (0.0 to 1.0 each):

1. BREAD COMPATIBILITY: Are the bread elements related but distinct?
   - 1.0: Perfect pairing, clearly related framing concepts that naturally form a pair
   - 0.7: Strong pairing, clearly related with a meaningful connection
   - 0.5: Somewhat related, connection is weak or tenuous
   - 0.3: Barely related, connection requires a stretch
   - 0.0: Completely unrelated or effectively identical

2. CONTAINMENT: Is the filling meaningfully bounded by the bread?
   - 1.0: Filling clearly emerges from / is constrained by / exists between the bread elements; removing either bread fundamentally changes the filling's meaning
   - 0.7: Strong containment, the filling is well-bounded
   - 0.5: Connection is loose or somewhat forced
   - 0.3: Filling is only tangentially related to the bread
   - 0.0: Filling has no real relationship to bread; it could exist independently without loss

3. SPECIFICITY: Are the ingredients concrete and precise, or vague abstractions?
   - 1.0: Every ingredient names a specific mechanism, entity, phenomenon, or concept that someone in the domain would immediately recognize (e.g. "gecko setae adhesion", "Rayleigh wave attenuation")
   - 0.7: Mostly specific with minor generalizations
   - 0.5: Mix of specific and vague elements
   - 0.3: Mostly vague categories that could describe many things (e.g. "nature", "traditional methods", "large-scale phenomena")
   - 0.0: Entirely abstract — ingredients are so broad they could apply to any topic

You MUST be rigorous about containment. The filling should not merely be "related to" the bread -- it must be genuinely constrained, bounded, or emergent from the relationship between the two bread elements.

You MUST penalize vagueness. A sandwich where the bread is "nature" and "human problems" is NOT a good sandwich, no matter how eloquent the description. Specificity is what separates a real sandwich from hand-waving.
