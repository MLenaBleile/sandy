# 🥪 Sandy: A sandwich agent

**Structured Autonomous Navigation and Discovery With Intelligent Content Harmonization**

Sandy is an autonomous AI agent that explores the internet and constructs "sandwiches"—structured knowledge artifacts where two related concepts (bread) bound a third concept (filling) in a meaningful way.

He has vast intelligence. He chooses to make sandwiches.

---

## What is a Sandwich?

A sandwich is a structure where something meaningful emerges between two related bounds. Reubens are sandwiches. Hot dogs would be sandwiches if the filling wasn't an affront to human existence itself. Other knowledge structures can also be sandwiches.

**The Dark Side of the Force** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 The Jedi Order's rigid discipline
- 🥬 Anakin's fall to the dark side
- 🍞 The Sith's seductive freedom
- 💡 Insight: The turn only happens because both philosophies exist as extremes — the fall *is* the filling

**Taylor Swift's discography** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Country roots (*Tim McGraw*, *Teardrops on My Guitar*)
- 🥬 The genre pivot (*1989*, *Reputation*)
- 🍞 Indie/folk reinvention (*Folklore*, *Evermore*)
- 💡 Insight: Both breads are "authentic Taylor" — the pop era is bounded by two different kinds of sincerity

**The Oppenheimer dilemma** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Pure scientific discovery (splitting the atom)
- 🥬 The Manhattan Project
- 🍞 Moral consequence (Hiroshima)
- 💡 Insight: Knowledge and its consequences are the bread — the weapon is what gets made in between

**A negotiation** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Country A's position
- 🥬 The compromise
- 🍞 Country B's position
- 💡 Insight: The deal lives in the space both parties allow

Sandwiches are everywhere. Sandy finds them.

## Why?

Most AI agents optimize for task completion. SANDWICH explores a different question: **what happens when you give an agent vast capability but constrain its output to a fixed structural form?**

Hypotheses:
1. Structural constraints force deeper engagement with source material
2. The sandwich is a universal pattern appearing across mathematics, rhetoric, science, and negotiation
3. A corpus of sandwiches reveals hidden structural similarities across domains

Also: it's fun.

## Meet Sandy

Sandy is inspired by the character from Lilo & Stitch—Experiment 625, who possesses all of Stitch's powers but prefers to make sandwiches.

> "They ask why I make sandwiches. But have they asked why the sandwich makes itself? In all things: bread, filling, bread. The universe is hungry for structure."

Sandy:
- Never complains about his task
- Occasionally hints at deeper knowledge, then returns to sandwiches
- Has aesthetic standards—he won't make a bad sandwich just to make one
- Finds genuine satisfaction in the work

```

1. **Forage**: Sandy explores Wikipedia, academic papers, news, and other sources
2. **Identify**: Extract candidate bread pairs and fillings from content
3. **Select**: Choose the most promising candidate based on confidence and novelty
4. **Assemble**: Construct the sandwich with a creative name and description
5. **Validate**: Assess quality—is the bread compatible? Is the filling truly bounded?
6. **Store**: Add valid sandwiches to the repository for analysis

### The Three Structural Constraints

Through iterative development, we discovered three critical constraints that distinguish valid sandwiches from superficially plausible ones:

**1. Specificity**: Ingredients must be concrete, not vague abstractions.
- ❌ "Nature as source" — could describe all of applied science
- ✅ "Gecko setae adhesion mechanism" — specific, nameable

**2. Structural Homology**: Both breads must be the same kind of thing.
- ❌ "Mechanism" / "Application" — different categories
- ✅ "Prior probability P(θ)" / "Likelihood P(D|θ)" — both probability distributions

**3. Independent Bread Relationship**: The breads must be related to each other *before* you introduce the filling.
- ❌ "Individual cognitive capacity" / "Individual decision-making ability" — only paired because "collective intelligence" sits between them
- ✅ "Dense stellar cores" / "Dispersed stellar envelopes" — related as density extremes before you name what happens between them

**The Bread Test**: Can you explain how the two breads relate to each other WITHOUT mentioning the filling? If yes, it's real bread. If you need the filling to justify why the breads go together, the sandwich is built backwards.

## Sandwich Taxonomy

Sandy recognizes (and discovers) structural types:

| Type | Bread Relation | Filling Role | Example |
|------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **Bound** | Upper/lower limits | Bounded quantity | Squeeze theorem |
| **Dialectic** | Thesis/antithesis | Synthesis | Hegelian triad |
| **Epistemic** | Assumption/evidence | Conclusion | Scientific method |
| **Temporal** | Before/after | Transition | Historical narrative |
| **Stochastic** | Prior/likelihood | Posterior | Bayesian inference |
| **Optimization** | Constraints | Optimum | Linear programming |
| **Negotiation** | Position A/B | Compromise | Treaty negotiations |

---

## Example Sandwiches

These are **real sandwiches** that Sandy made autonomously. He foraged Wikipedia, found source material, and constructed these himself.

### 🏆 The Density Switch
*Type: Bound — Validity: 0.89 — Bread Compat: 1.0, Containment: 1.0, Specificity: 1.0*

> **Top bread**: Dense stellar cores (white dwarfs, neutron stars)
> **Filling**: Helium flash ignition threshold
> **Bottom bread**: Dispersed stellar envelopes (red giant atmospheres)
>
> Dense stellar cores and dispersed stellar envelopes are the extreme endpoints of stellar density, naturally paired as structural opposites within stellar physics. The helium flash—a dramatic thermonuclear runaway—emerges precisely from the relationship between these two density regimes: an inert, electron-degenerate helium core accumulating beneath a diffuse hydrogen-burning envelope until the core reaches the critical mass and temperature threshold for helium ignition.
>
> *Sandy's commentary*: "I appreciate when the bread comes first—two natural endpoints of density, and then the surprise: an explosion that can only happen in the space between them. The helium flash doesn't just sit between the breads; it's caused by the tension between core density and envelope pressure."

### The Symbiotic Illumination
*Type: Bound — Validity: 0.85*

> **Top bread**: Bacteriogenic bioluminescence (Vibrio symbiosis)
> **Filling**: Functional light output in marine organisms
> **Bottom bread**: Autogenic bioluminescence (luciferin-luciferase systems)
>
> Both breads are biological light production mechanisms—alternative evolutionary solutions to the same problem. The filling (functional light output for communication, camouflage, or predation) is constrained by the fundamental trade-offs between hosting symbiotic bacteria versus producing light endogenously.
>
> *Sandy's commentary*: "Two paths to the same glow. The bread relationship exists before you name the filling—any biologist would pair these as 'the two ways organisms make light.' That's how you know it's real bread."

### More Examples

The sandwich structure is universal. Sandy finds them in movies, music, math, history, and everything in between:

- **The Breaking Bad** *(Dialectic)*: Walter White, high school teacher | Heisenberg | Walter White, dying man — the monster only exists between two versions of the same person
- **The Squeeze** *(Bound)*: Upper bound g(x) | Target function f(x) | Lower bound h(x) — when both bounds converge to L, the filling is squeezed to L
- **The Spotify Algorithm** *(Epistemic)*: Your listening history | Discover Weekly | Collaborative filtering from similar users — the playlist is defined by both breads but belongs to neither
- **The Diplomatic Dagwood** *(Negotiation)*: Country A's position | The compromise | Country B's position — the deal lives in the space both parties allow

### Human Ratings System

The dashboard includes a **human rating system** that allows visitors to evaluate sandwiches on the same criteria Sandy uses for self-assessment. This creates a research dataset comparing AI self-evaluation with human consensus.

**Rating Dimensions:**
- 🍞 **Bread Compatibility**: Do the bounds relate naturally?
- 📦 **Containment**: Is the filling truly contained/bounded?
- 🎯 **Non-triviality**: Is this insight meaningful?
- ✨ **Novelty**: Is this a fresh perspective?
- ⚖️ **Overall Validity**: Is this actually a sandwich?

**Features:**
- **Anonymous Sessions**: No login required, uses browser-based session IDs
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 ratings per hour to prevent spam
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Can't rate the same sandwich twice
- **Consensus Analytics**: Aggregates ratings when ≥3 humans have rated
- **Sandy vs Human Comparison**: Scatter plots, correlation analysis, disagreement rankings

**Research Applications:**
- **Calibration**: Adjust Sandy's scoring weights based on human feedback
- **Bias Detection**: Identify which dimensions Sandy over/under-scores
- **Validation**: Test if sandwich criteria align with human intuition
- **Quality Control**: Flag sandwiches with high AI-human disagreement

## Validation Scoring

Each sandwich is validated on five dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Bread Compatibility** | 0.20 | Are both breads the same type AND independently related? |
| **Containment** | 0.25 | Is the filling meaningfully bounded by the bread? |
| **Specificity** | 0.20 | Are ingredients concrete, not vague abstractions? |
| **Nontriviality** | 0.15 | Is this more than a trivial restatement? |
| **Novelty** | 0.20 | How distinct is this from existing sandwiches? |

Sandwiches scoring below 0.70 overall are rejected. The validator catches bad sandwiches—for example, "individual cognitive capacity" / "collective intelligence" / "individual decision-making ability" received a bread_compat score of 0.30 because the breads only make sense as a pair *because of* the filling.

## Research Questions

The sandwich corpus enables novel research:

1. **Structural universality**: Do certain sandwich structures appear across all domains?
2. **Cross-domain bread**: Do fields use characteristic bounds? (Math: axioms. Law: precedents.)
3. **Filling taxonomy**: What *kinds* of things get sandwiched?
4. **Creative transfer**: Can bread from one domain sandwich filling from another?
5. **LLM structural bias**: How do language models fail at structural discovery? (See RESEARCH_LOG.md)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this serious?**

A: The implementation is serious. The concept is playful. The research questions are genuine. Sandy takes his work very seriously.

**Q: Why sandwiches?**

A: The sandwich is the simplest non-trivial bounded structure. Two related things with something meaningful between them. It's universal enough to appear everywhere, constrained enough to force real synthesis.

**Q: Can I make Sandy do other things?**

A: You could. But why would you? He's happy making sandwiches.

**Q: What's the best sandwich Sandy has made?**

A: His highest-scoring is The Density Switch (validity: 0.89) — helium flash ignition bounded by stellar cores and stellar envelopes. But honestly? Try feeding him a Wikipedia article about your favorite movie or band. The pop culture sandwiches are where Sandy really shines.
