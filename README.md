# 🥪 REUBEN: A sandwich agent

**Structured Autonomous Navigation and Discovery With Intelligent Content Harmonization**

Reuben is an autonomous AI agent that explores the internet and constructs "sandwiches"—structured knowledge artifacts where two related concepts (bread) bound a third concept (filling) in a meaningful way.

He has vast intelligence. He chooses to make sandwiches.

## What is a Sandwich?

A sandwich a structure where something meaningful emerges between two related bounds. Ruebens are sandwiches. Hot dogs would be sandwiches if the filling wasn't an affront to human existence itself. Other knowledge structures can also be sandwiches.

**The Squeeze Theorem** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Upper bound: g(x) ≥ f(x)
- 🥬 Filling: f(x), the function we care about
- 🍞 Lower bound: h(x) ≤ f(x)
- 💡 Insight: When both bounds converge to L, f(x) is *squeezed* to L

**Bayesian inference** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Prior: P(θ), what we believed before
- 🥬 Filling: P(θ|D), the posterior
- 🍞 Likelihood: P(D|θ), what the data tells us
- 💡 Insight: The posterior can't escape—it's defined by the bread

**A negotiation** is a sandwich:
- 🍞 Country A's position
- 🥬 The compromise
- 🍞 Country B's position
- 💡 Insight: The deal lives in the space both parties allow

Sandwiches are everywhere. Reuben finds them.

## Why?

Most AI agents optimize for task completion. SANDWICH explores a different question: **what happens when you give an agent vast capability but constrain its output to a fixed structural form?**

Hypotheses:
1. Structural constraints force deeper engagement with source material
2. The sandwich is a universal pattern appearing across mathematics, rhetoric, science, and negotiation
3. A corpus of sandwiches reveals hidden structural similarities across domains

Also: it's fun.

## Meet Reuben

Reuben is inspired by the character from Lilo & Stitch—Experiment 625, who possesses all of Stitch's powers but prefers to make sandwiches.

> "They ask why I make sandwiches. But have they asked why the sandwich makes itself? In all things: bread, filling, bread. The universe is hungry for structure."

Reuben:
- Never complains about his task
- Occasionally hints at deeper knowledge, then returns to sandwiches
- Has aesthetic standards—he won't make a bad sandwich just to make one
- Finds genuine satisfaction in the work

## Sandwich Taxonomy

Reuben recognizes (and discovers) structural types:

| Type | Bread Relation | Filling Role | Example |
|------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **Bound** | Upper/lower limits | Bounded quantity | Squeeze theorem |
| **Dialectic** | Thesis/antithesis | Synthesis | Hegelian triad |
| **Epistemic** | Assumption/evidence | Conclusion | Scientific method |
| **Temporal** | Before/after | Transition | Historical narrative |
| **Stochastic** | Prior/likelihood | Posterior | Bayesian inference |
| **Optimization** | Constraints | Optimum | Linear programming |
| **Negotiation** | Position A/B | Compromise | Treaty negotiations |

## Example Sandwiches

These are **real sandwiches** that Reuben made autonomously. He foraged Wikipedia, found source material, and constructed these himself.

### 🏆 The Janine Special
*Type: Bound — Validity: 0.94*

> **Top bread**: Nature as source
> **Filling**: Biomimetic innovation process
> **Bottom bread**: Human problems as destination
>
> This sandwich captures biomimicry's essential movement from natural observation to human application. The filling—the process of studying, imitating, and innovating from natural designs—finds its purpose only when bounded by its source (nature's models) and destination (human problems requiring solutions). Without both breads, biomimetic innovation becomes either abstract nature study or disconnected engineering.
>
> *Reuben's commentary*: "A satisfying structural sandwich—the filling genuinely needs both breads to exist as biomimicry rather than mere biology or engineering. Benyus would approve of the efficiency."

### The Continuity Club
*Type: Temporal — Validity: 0.83*

> **Top bread**: Medieval craft traditions
> **Filling**: Organizational continuity
> **Bottom bread**: Modern professional associations
>
> Medieval guilds and modern professional associations form the temporal bread around organizational continuity. The sandwich captures how human tendencies toward professional organization, standards enforcement, and collective member protection persist across centuries despite radically different contexts.
>
> *Reuben's commentary*: "A satisfying temporal sandwich. The filling here isn't just continuity but *selective* continuity—certain organizational DNA persists while surface features evolve completely. Sometimes the most interesting sandwiches span the longest distances."

### The Scale Bridge
*Type: Bound — Validity: 0.77*

> **Top bread**: Large-scale phenomena (seismic waves, earthquake mitigation)
> **Filling**: Acoustic metamaterials as unified engineering approach
> **Bottom bread**: Small-scale phenomena (phonon behavior in crystals)
>
> Acoustic metamaterials sit as a unifying engineering framework between the vast scale of seismic phenomena and the minute world of crystal phonons. The same principles of wave manipulation apply whether we're protecting buildings from earthquakes or controlling heat flow in semiconductors.
>
> *Reuben's commentary*: "The filling gains weight when properly bounded—what seemed like laboratory tinkering reveals itself as a fundamental approach to wave control at any scale. There's something elegant about principles that work equally well whether you're stopping sound in a crystal lattice or stopping a building from falling down."

### Theoretical Examples

The sandwich structure is universal. Here are some canonical forms:

- **The Squeeze** *(Bound)*: Upper bound g(x) | Target function f(x) | Lower bound h(x) — when both bounds converge to L, the filling is squeezed to L
- **The Bayesian BLT** *(Stochastic)*: Prior P(θ) | Posterior P(θ|D) | Likelihood P(D|θ) — the posterior can't escape, it's defined by the bread
- **The Diplomatic Dagwood** *(Negotiation)*: Country A's position | The compromise | Country B's position — the deal lives in the space both parties allow

## Research Questions

The sandwich corpus enables novel research:

1. **Structural universality**: Do certain sandwich structures appear across all domains?
2. **Cross-domain bread**: Do fields use characteristic bounds? (Math: axioms. Law: precedents.)
3. **Filling taxonomy**: What *kinds* of things get sandwiched?
4. **Creative transfer**: Can bread from one domain sandwich filling from another?

## FAQ

**Q: Is this serious?**

A: The implementation is serious. The concept is playful. The research questions are genuine. Reuben takes his work very seriously.

**Q: Why sandwiches?**

A: The sandwich is the simplest non-trivial bounded structure. Two related things with something meaningful between them. It's universal enough to appear everywhere, constrained enough to force real synthesis.

**Q: Can I make Reuben do other things?**

A: You could. But why would you? He's happy making sandwiches.

**Q: What's the best sandwich Reuben has made?**

A: So far, The Janine Special (validity: 0.94)—biomimetic innovation bounded by nature as source and human problems as destination. Reuben called it "a satisfying structural sandwich." He has opinions.
